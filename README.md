# entry-list-examples
A simple entry list example in multiple different frameworks/languages.

The point is to highlight how a simple example can be built in a few different front-end languages or frameworks.
This is by no means indicative of framework or language quality and is a really dead simple example. I'm guessing I'm not
doing idiomatic framework for some of these either. That's okay :)

Currently, I have examples for Angular, Elm, and React, all of which can be opened up in a browser and played with simply.
